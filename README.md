# llnet_implementation
This is an implementation of the "LLNet: A deep autoencoder approach to natural low-light image
enhancement" paper for brightening up images taken under low-light conditions.
I have modified the model architecture to be used in color images as compared to gray-scale images as described in the paper.
The code is implemented on an IPython Notebook with the necessary code required to run on Google Colab.

The paper can be accessed from [here.](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S003132031630125X?token=3660BF88E5B10F810C0E93B39AEEA5E8B4C0D66E6654F28D92A6A53A8751EF2F9B8518E956192B9CBCC3B80066280200)
